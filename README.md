# MP3-Tag-Reader-Writer
The objective was to create an MP3 Tag Reader/Writer application in C that reads and modifies metadata from MP3 files using the ID3v2.3 tag format. The application extracted, displayed, and updated essential metadata such as Title, Artist, Album, Year, Genre, and other frame-based information.
